        Wrestling is the fourth oldest Olympic sports and one of the oldest sports ever. Wrestling has been played since 708 BCE and is still practiced today. Wrestling is a sport in which two competitors, use force and agility to get their opponent to touch the ground with any other part of their body except for their hands or feet. Wrestling is one of very few sports where there is very minimal equipment required.

      <h3>Scoring</h3>
      <p>
        Scoring
          The rule system differs in the different styles of wrestling and how you score different points. Here is how each style is scored:
          Folkstyle: when you get a “Takedown” (when get behind your opponent when one of their knees is touching the mat) you score 2 points for a “Takedown”. When you are on the bottom position and you “Reverse” to where you are on top of the opponent you score 2 points for a “Reversal”. When you are on the bottom position, and you stand up and are both facing each other you score 1 point for an “Escape”. If you are on the top position and get the opponent on their back but they aren’t quite touching you score something called “Near fall”. Near fall points only come when you hold them for longer than 3 seconds, after 3 seconds of exposure of the back, you score 2 points and after 5 seconds you score 3. That is the basic scoring system for Folkstyle wrestling. 
          Freestyle: When you get behind the opponent and any part of their body apart from their hands or feet is toughing the ground then you score a “Take down” which is 2 points.  You are awarded 2 points for “throwing” your opponent and exposing their back, this is rewarded as 2 points. You can score a 2-point throw from the top position.  If you throw your opponent in an “Arcing throw” usually throwing your opponent anywhere above the hips and exposing their back is counted as 5 points. If you push your opponent to the edge of the circle and they touch any part outside of the circle you score 1 point. 
          Greco Roman: There are not many ways to score in Greco Roman. The same as in Freestyle if you “Throw” your opponent you score 2 points. If you get on top of your opponent, you are also rewarded 2 as a “Take Down”.  If you throw your opponent where their legs are extended over their head, and you land on top of them then you are awarded 5 points. And if you reverse from the bottom position to be on top then you are awarded 1 point. And lastly If you push your opponent out of the circle you score 1 point.

      <p>
        How to win
          There are three different types of wrestling that are practiced today. There is Folkstyle, Freestyle, and Greco Roman. All three have similar components included in them. 
          Folkstyle: is practiced almost exclusively through high school and collegiate levels. To win a Folkstyle wrestling match a competitor has to get his opponent to their back or beating them by scoring 16 points more than the opponent. 
          Freestyle: is very similar to that of Folkstyle, you have to get your opponent to their back or beat them by gaining 10 more points more than your opponent. Freestyle is practiced more as a professional sport and a club sport. Freestyle is the more practiced of the three different types of wrestling and is one of the Olympic versions of wrestling.  
          Greco Roman: is the oldest version of wrestling. Greco Roman, like the other versions has a similar winning method. You must pin your opponent to the mat on their back for 5 seconds to win or gain 8 more points than your opponent. Greco Roman is scored almost exactly the same as Freestyle and fairly different than that of Folkstyle.
