    <h3>
        <p>I am from the north eastern region of the United States.</p>
        <p>I am here at BYUI studying Computer Science. The reason why I started to study CS was kind of a random choice of mine that I made and I am not looking back!</p>
        <p>Growing up my whole life I was really into Freestyle wreslting! I love to be outdoors and love to do anything with sports.</p>
        <p>My knowledge in web design is very small. I have never done any web design, I did a little bit of coding in my previous semester and I really enjoyed it! Im very excited to extend my knowledge in coding and web design!</p>
